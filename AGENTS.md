# Local Agent Rules (Session)

## Execution Persistence
- Keep going through planned milestones end-to-end.
- Do not stop after status reports or milestone summaries.
- Only pause when blocked by missing credentials, destructive-risk approval, or explicit user stop.

## Delivery Mode
- TDD first for every feature slice.
- Each milestone must be runnable and test-green before commit.
- Keep milestones reviewable as separate branch/PR steps.
